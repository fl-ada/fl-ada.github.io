Since it was decided that I need to move back to my home country after 10 years of wandering around different countries, I had looked for some chances to prepare to work in here.

I've sometimes felt that I cannot completely belong to any of the groups due to quite unusual background. However after realizing no ones can ever have completely same lives and being understood by others, I have been trying to find 'what I can do' to adopt in the new environment while make advantage of my specialities.

Taking two exams to get certificate of ADsP(Advanced Data Semi-Professional) and SQLD(SQL Developer) is to let myself be used to some of the terms used in Korean companies and to review and fill some skill and knowledge gaps after my UG education.

ADsP exam had finished last Saturday, and pretty sure I passed, and SQLD is on coming Saturday, and I am well prepared. I just thought that it might have been better to write this journal in Korean, but it is just to record inofficially, so I guess it is still fine!
