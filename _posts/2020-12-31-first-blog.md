This is the last day of me being a student, although the last grades are not yet come out and my graduation certificate is only available around Oct or Nov next year. Since my last final exam in UG life completed a couple of days before 2020 Christmas, I just personally set today, the last day of 2020, as the day.

Let's celebrate! 🎉

Well, I did celebrate on Christmas Eve with a cheap bottle of wine with mom, so l'll just count it as one.

> On the last day of being a student and the first day of being a free person without any affiliation except to-be-alumni, I open my tech & personal kind of offical blog here.
